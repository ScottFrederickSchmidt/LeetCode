def romanToInt(s):
    roman={'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50, 'C':100, 'D':500, 'M':1000} 
    count=0
    
    for x in s:
        count=count+roman[x] #retrieved the value in the dictionary 
    return count #returns answer


s = "III" # correctly prints 3
s = "IV" #correctly prints 6
s= "LVIII" #correctly prints 58
s="MCMXCIV" #INCORRECT should print 1994;  Currently prints 2216
#s = "VI" 

s1=romanToInt(s)    
print(s1)
