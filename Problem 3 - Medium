LeetCode3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, first medium problem.
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
