#Problem 175 SQL:
#Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table.
#If the address of a PersonId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
#Return the result table in any order.
#There is no address in the address table for the PersonId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
#AddressId = 1 contains information about the address of PersonId = 2.
--------------------------------------------------

#Solution #1: This "solution" is all correct except it only retrieves ONE row not all of them.
#Therefore, one must use a JOIN and ON statement upon further research.
SELECT person.FirstName, person.LastName, address.City, address.State
FROM person, address
WHERE person.PersonId = address.AddressId+1;


#Solution2: This was really close to being correct, I just used INNER join instead of outer JOIN:
SELECT person.FirstName, person.LastName, address.City, address.State
FROM person, address
INNER JOIN
person.PersonId = address.AddressId+1;

#Accepted Final Solution:
SELECT person.FirstName, person.LastName, address.City, address.State
FROM person
LEFT OUTER JOIN address
ON person.PersonId = address.AddressId+1;
