https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer.
The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. 
The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits
--------------
1)Get last digit, add one
2)Change parameter list last number to last digit

class Solution(object):
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        last=digits[-1]+1
        digits[-1]=last
        return digits

However, this answer fails example 4:
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

If the last digit is a 9, the list should split into a 1 and 0.
Therefore, the logic of this problems needs to be slightly changed.
