#My first attempt was correct, but got rejected for being too slow.

import itertools

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        index=[] #store indexes to be returned at end
        for numbers in itertools.combinations(nums,2):
            if sum(numbers)==target: #if the sum of these numbers 
                for n in numbers: # find each num in numbers
                    index.append(nums.index(n)) #add index to 
        return index #this is the answer
